So your organization wants to have the ability to create ID cards in-house, and you’ve been assigned to find the best ID card printer. What’s the best ID card printer available? The short answer: there isn’t a “best” printer. Sorry!

While there isn’t a one-size-fits-all ID card printer, there’s definitely a printer that’s ideal for your specific printing requirements. But how do you know which one is right for you? It’s easier than you might think, because we offer a variety of helpful tools that will allow you to become an informed and confident ID card printer shopper!

A great way to initially narrow down your choices is to answer five key questions before you even start to think about shopping, namely:

1. How much information will cards display?
If you’re only including a limited amount of information on your ID cards – like name, photo, and company logo – single-sided printers are the way to go. If you need to print more information than the basics (e.g., employee ID number, barcode, cardholder title, department, etc.), dual-sided printers are the optimal choice.

2. What about data storage on your cards?
You’ll want to choose a printer with encoding capabilities which allows you to add important information – like cardholder details or access privileges – onto a card’s magnetic stripe or directly onto technology cards like smart cards or proximity cards.

3. What type of card will you be printing to?
This is integral, because the type of card you use dictates which printing technology that’s best for you. Retransfer printers are the logical choice as they use special technology for printing on cards with uneven surfaces like proximity cards or smart cards. For printing on basic plastic cards, direct-to-card printers make the most sense, but retransfer printers can also be used for outstanding visual quality and durability.
